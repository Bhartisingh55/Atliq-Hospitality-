# Atliq-Hospitality-
As part of the September month Codebaiscs resume challenge, I have built a dashboard in Power BI to analyze three months sales data of different AtliQ hotels across four different cities.
Challange : AtliQ Hospitality Analysis

Tool used : PowerBI

Problem statement-

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

Learnings things from this Project: 


Snowflake data model.

How to use KPI indicators, especially when there is inverse proportionality.

I contacted few of my friends working in hospitality domain where I got to know that people tend to cancel the bookings if they have booked it more than 1 week prior. This can also be seen through the data we have.
